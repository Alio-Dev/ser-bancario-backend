# CRUD Operations & Activity Logging Implementation

## Overview
Fully functional Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations have been implemented for all database tables with automatic activity logging.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Full CRUD Operations

All tables now support complete CRUD functionality:

- **Users** - Add, edit, delete users with role management
- **Articles** - Create and manage articles with status tracking
- **Events** - Manage events with dates and locations
- **Sponsors** - Add sponsors with tier levels and active/inactive status
- **Categories** - Manage content categories
- **Tags** - Create and organize tags

### 2. Automatic Activity Logging

Every database operation is automatically logged to the `activity_logs` table:

**Logged Information:**
- Action type (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Table name
- Record ID
- Old values (for UPDATE and DELETE)
- New values (for INSERT and UPDATE)
- Timestamp
- IP address (placeholder for now)
- User ID (placeholder for now)

**Implementation Details:**
- Activity logging happens in API routes after successful operations
- Logging uses a dedicated utility function (`lib/activity-logger.ts`)
- Logs are created for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
- Logging errors are caught and logged to console without breaking the main operation

### 3. Form Dialogs

Each table has a dedicated form dialog component:

- `UserFormDialog` - User management with role selection
- `ArticleFormDialog` - Article creation with status and content fields
- `EventFormDialog` - Event scheduling with dates and locations
- `SponsorFormDialog` - Sponsor management with tier and active status
- `CategoryFormDialog` - Category creation with name, slug, and description
- `TagFormDialog` - Simple tag creation with name and slug

**Form Features:**
- Modal dialogs for clean UX
- Separate Add/Edit modes
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Success notifications via toast

### 4. Read-Only Activity Logs

The Activity Logs page is fully read-only:

- **No Edit Button** - Users cannot modify logged activities
- **No Add Button** - Logs are only system-generated
- **No Delete Button** - Logs cannot be removed
- Visual indicator explaining logs are automatic and non-editable
- Search and export functionality still available

### 5. API Routes with Logging

**GET `/api/tables/[table]`**
- List all records with pagination
- Search functionality
- Sorting options
- No logging (read operations)

**POST `/api/tables/[table]`**
- Create new record
- **Automatic INSERT log created**
- Returns created record

**GET `/api/tables/[table]/[id]`**
- Get single record
- No logging (read operation)

**PUT `/api/tables/[table]/[id]`**
- Update record
- Fetches old values before update
- **Automatic UPDATE log created** with old and new values
- Returns updated record

**DELETE `/api/tables/[table]/[id]`**
- Delete record
- Fetches record before deletion
- **Automatic DELETE log created** with old values
- Returns success message

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New User

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/users`
2. Click "Add New" button
3. Fill in username, email, and select role
4. Click "Add User"
5. Record is created in database
6. Activity log automatically records INSERT operation
7. Success toast notification appears
8. Table refreshes to show new user

### Editing an Article

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/articles`
2. Click edit icon on any article row
3. Modify fields in the dialog
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Record is updated in database
6. Activity log automatically records UPDATE with old and new values
7. Success toast notification appears
8. Table refreshes to show updated article

### Deleting an Event

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/events`
2. Click delete icon on any event row
3. Confirm deletion in browser prompt
4. Record is deleted from database
5. Activity log automatically records DELETE with old values
6. Success toast notification appears
7. Table refreshes to remove deleted event

### Viewing Activity Logs

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/activity-logs`
2. See all system activities chronologically
3. Search by action type, table name, or IP
4. Notice: No edit/add/delete buttons visible
5. Export logs to CSV if needed
6. Logs cannot be modified or deleted

## Security & Data Integrity

### Activity Logs Protection

1. **No UI Controls** - Edit, Add, and Delete buttons hidden via `readOnly` prop
2. **Automatic Generation** - Only system can create logs via API routes
3. **Immutable** - No UPDATE or DELETE operations in UI
4. **Audit Trail** - Complete history of all database changes
5. **Non-deletable** - Logs persist indefinitely for compliance

### RLS Policies

Activity logs table has specific policies:
- SELECT: Only admins can view
- INSERT: System can insert (authenticated users)
- UPDATE: Not allowed
- DELETE: Not allowed

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Add Operation
```bash
# Via UI: Click Add New on any table page
# Verify: New record appears and activity log shows INSERT
```

### Test Update Operation
```bash
# Via UI: Click edit icon, modify data, save
# Verify: Record updates and activity log shows UPDATE with old/new values
```

### Test Delete Operation
```bash
# Via UI: Click delete icon, confirm
# Verify: Record removed and activity log shows DELETE with old values
```

### Test Activity Logs
```bash
# Via UI: Navigate to Activity Logs page
# Verify: No edit/add/delete buttons visible
# Verify: All operations from above appear in chronological order
```

## API Response Examples
